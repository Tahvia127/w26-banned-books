# w26-banned-books

This project examines the relationship between book bans and public engagement to understand whether censorship attempts backfire through increased attention. Using PEN America’s banned books database as our foundation, members will track which books face challenges across different states and school districts. Members will then analyze corresponding shifts in public interest through Google Trends search data, Goodreads ratings and review activity, and social media discourse patterns. 

The core questions: Do banned books experience “Streisand effects” with popularity spikes after challenges? Does engagement differ by book content type (LGBTQ+ themes vs. racial justice vs. sexual content)? Can online discourse predict where future bans will emerge, or does it only react afterwards? 

The final deliverable will be a dashboard that displays geographic trends through visualizations, for example showing states with high discourse but few bans versus high-ban areas with suppressed discussion, revealing how censorship and reading culture intersect across America’s political landscape.
